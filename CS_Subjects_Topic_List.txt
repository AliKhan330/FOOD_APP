Basics of Programming:
- Variables and Data Types
- Input/Output Operations
- Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise, etc.)
- Control Flow (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions & Recursion
- Arrays (1D, 2D, Multidimensional)
- Strings and their Operations
- Pointers
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Structures and Unions
- File Handling
- Error Types (Syntax, Runtime, Logical)
- Best Practices

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Class and Object
- Constructors and Destructors
- `this` pointer
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hybrid)
- Polymorphism (Compile-time and Run-time)
- Access Specifiers (public, private, protected)
- Static Members
- Friend Function and Friend Class
- Operator Overloading
- Templates (Function and Class Templates)
- Exception Handling
- Interfaces & Abstract Classes (Java, C#)

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):
- Time and Space Complexity (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega)
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues (Circular, Priority Queue)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Heap, Segment Tree, Trie)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST)
- Searching and Sorting (Linear, Binary, Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Hashing (Hash Table, Collision Handling)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sliding Window & Two Pointer Techniques

Database Management Systems (DBMS):
- Database Concepts (Schemas, Instances)
- DBMS vs File System
- Architecture (1-tier, 2-tier, 3-tier)
- ER Model (Entities, Relationships, Attributes)
- Relational Model
- Keys (Primary, Candidate, Foreign, Composite, Super)
- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, Joins, Views, Indexes)
- Transactions and ACID Properties
- Concurrency Control (Locks, Deadlocks)
- Recovery Techniques
- NoSQL vs SQL
- Stored Procedures and Triggers

Operating Systems (OS):
- Introduction and Functions of OS
- Process vs Thread
- Process States & PCB
- Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority)
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Synchronization (Critical Section, Semaphores, Mutex)
- Deadlocks (Detection, Prevention, Avoidance - Banker's)
